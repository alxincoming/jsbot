# jsbot

this repository is made by #Yohannes aweke and it's a telegram bot using a java script programing language 

  how does this bot works
   1, welcome the user to the bot 
   2, ask them to send the file in pdf or doc format it also accpts docx
   3, if the user send a file with other file format then the bot will ask then to send their file in the given format again 
   4,  after accepting the file the bot askes the users to share their phone number iy providing the "share" button bellow the chat space 
   5, when the user share their phone number then the bot thanks them and asks if ther is additional thing they want to add on their printing service 
   6, if they don't have anything to say the bot provide a skip button 
   7, then after finishing this all step the bot desplays a message your order have been made.
   8, after doing this all process the main thing done behind this all conversation is the bot accept all the data (the file, their contact , and their additional message) the bot forward this all thing to the owner of the bot.
   
This is what the bot does.
